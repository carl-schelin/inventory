<p><strong><u>E-Mail Query</u></strong></p>

<p>The E-Mail Query system was put into place in order to provide a method of retrieving information from the Inventory when you're not at a computer, such as in a meeting and someone asks 
about a system specifications, or when at home responding to a monitoring alert. The E-Mail Query can be used by anyone who has an account in the Inventory and the sending email address 
matches their profile email or alternate email fields.</p>


<p><strong><u>Process</u></strong></p>

<p>The process is pretty simple. You send an email to <mailto>inventory@<?php print $hostname; ?></mailto> with a subject line that consists of the server name, product for a listing of servers, 
or IP address. Without passing options on the Subject line, you'll get the detail record for the server. You can also pass a word or letter on the subject line for a specific query which returns 
the detail record plus the additional information.</p>


<p><strong><u>Technical Bits</u></strong></p>

<p>Here is the process that occurs when you send a query:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You create an email message, sending to the inventory server or product name in the subject line, and optionally, any flags for additional data.</li>
  <li>The inventory server receives the email and checks the sender (you) against a list of email addresses that are permitted to send to the Inventory. Only company specific addresses are permitted.</li>
  <li>Assuming everything passes, the script parses the server name or product and options, formats the output, and returns it to you.</li>
  <li>If you don't have an account in the Inventory, you won't get a response. If you do have an account and the subject line is incorrect or unclear, you'll receive a help email.</li>
</ul>
